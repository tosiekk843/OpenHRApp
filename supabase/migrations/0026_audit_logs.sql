-- OpenHRApp — Tamper-resistant audit trail

-- Written after an incident in which two leave requests in one organization
-- were moved to REJECTED and it was impossible to determine who did it: the
-- database held no actor column and no history, so the only forensic evidence
-- was which remarks column happened to be non-null.
--
-- The trigger fires inside the database, so it records the actor even when the
-- write arrives straight from PostgREST, and it cannot be skipped by a client
-- that forgets to call a logging helper.
